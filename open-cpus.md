# Open CPUs

Most big vendor ISAs are patent protected, and you cna't implement them for free: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-you-need-a-license-from-ARM-to-design-an-ARM-CPU-How-are-the-instruction-sets-protected

Here we document ones which are not patented, and therefore serve as goot targets for learning hardware development, as you get the software ecosystem (compiler, Linux kernel, libc, QEMU) for free.

## OpenRISC

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRISC>

LGPL / GPL. TODO: history?

RISC-V says it is better than them.

## SuperH

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperH>

Renesas.

Some patents expired: <https://youtu.be/lZGHbMS882w?t=281>

### j-core

Open implementation.

## LEON

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEON>

Open architecture based on SPARC made by <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency>

## DLX

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLX>

## MIPS

TODO can it be implemented legally? I doubt it:
